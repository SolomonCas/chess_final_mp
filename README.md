# chess_final_mp
This project is a turn-based two-player board game, the rules of the game have a similar set of rules to the Game of the Generals, where each pieces have unique ranks for capturing the opponent's pieces, pieces can only move one space at a time. To win the game you either capture the opponent's Animal Den, which serves as the Flag in the Game of the Generals, or capture all the opponent's pieces. Â In some spaces of the board, there are sets of terrains that would affect the valid moves of a piece, for example water and traps. This is all done by 2 people using Java as a programming language with the touch of GUI for visualization.
